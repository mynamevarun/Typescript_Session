# Arrays
    let arr = [1,2,3,4];

    In JS we can have array with different type of value like integers with string and that is totally valid code.

    So define a type with it

    let numbers: number[] = [1,2,3];

    We can define array with any type.

    So here we can see the code completion feature we can see when we click period all method available for that variable.
