### Dev Environment Setup

Install node as we install TS with npm.

We will install TS globally so we can call typescript in any folder.

check the version

tsc -v

Create a hello world program using console. and execute it.

Now write some TS code. lets declare a variable 

This is the syntax

let age: number = 10;

If we see in JS file in place of let  there is var, as TS compiler uses older version ES5 so we will configure it to use new version.
